Hello! I am Quan Phung, a learner on the road to product ownership and project management.
SQL and Python are my main focus, as I believe they are the best languages to start off learning for data analysis.
With SQL conquered, my first priority is to view data trends, set product metrics and use statistical thinking in general.
As for Python, I am keen to do things like string together useless repetitive tasks, process data and construct tools to help with product development procedures.
I want to get in touch with my industry peers locally, study professionals with experience in the field and take an active part in more meaningful projects.
Join me in studying data analysis, development and product management. Share ideas with me and let's grow together!
